# Battery API example
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Zan22/pen/LYEKMxQ](https://codepen.io/Zan22/pen/LYEKMxQ).

 The functions that I added is that when the computer is charging, the battery's color become green and there is animated guy running from the left of page to right. However, when the computer is not charging, the battery's color become gray and the guy disappear.
